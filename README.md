A recreation of skyward sword's minesweeper with a solver

This is a copy of the Nintendo's minesweeper clone in Skyward Sword. It is identical to regular minesweeper except that while the rupees act like numbers in regular minesweeper, revealing how many bombs are adjacent, they do not give an exact value for the number of bombs. The blue rupee, for example, means that there are 2-3 bombs adjacent. This increases the difficulty of the game. There is also the addition of the ruporr which, while not ending your game like the bomb, subtracts from your score.

In the default version you can play the game just like minesweeper clicking on tiles to reveal and it will count up your points. Unlike normal minesweeper there are no flags so you only need to avoid cliking on tiles that you belive have a bomb.

In solver mode, you input the values of tiles you have revealed in a game and it tells you the safest squares to check next.
